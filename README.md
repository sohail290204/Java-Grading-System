# Java-Grading-System
I have created Java Grading system here you have two ways to login one as admin one as student. Admin can add student details and can add student marks and  at the end one certificate will be displayed. As an student Once a student is login with correct login details given by the Admin student can see his certificate with his Grade and percentage.
For Opening this project you have to Open this file in NetBeans and here i have used Glassfish server for servlet.
